# Point Primitive Lookalikes

This example is based on Defold's basic 3D project template, but with a material demonstrating a method to make line meshes resemble point primitives.

Defold does not currently support point primitives as an option for the Mesh component, so this technique is a workaround. See [Defold's Github](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/8701).
